# Generation Z Entertainment

Generation Z Entertainment is meant for kids of the late Z generation (born 2010+) who are growing up surrounded by information technology like smartphones, tablets, laptops and huge TVs and for whom there exists unfortunately very little completely free, adds-free, fun and educational content. It aims to provide a series of simple touchscreen application which kids love. These applications run best on standalone touch-PCs which can be fixed to a wall in childrens' playrooms. Keep your kids off your expensive & fragile gadgets by giving them their very own Generation Z Entertainment platform.

## Animal Media Player

Animal Media Player offers 1 to 3 year-old children some interaction with animal pictures and sounds.
It displays animal pictures in a grid and plays the animal's sound whenever they are pressed. When an animal is activated, the previous one is replaced with another random animal.

The content (images and sounds) is stored in an 'animals' folder, of which only a few samples are provided in the default application to not have to deal with any legal issues. The library will be extended in subsequent versions, but this application is also meant to participatory. Feel free to contribute to your child's experience by spending a few minutes searching the web for your favorite animal pictures and sounds to create your own extensions of the animal library.
