## Animal Media Player

Animal Media Player offers 1 to 3 year-old children some interaction with animal pictures and sounds.
It displays animal pictures in a grid and plays the animal's sound whenever they are pressed. When an animal is activated, the previous one is replaced with another random animal.

The content (images and sounds) is stored in an 'animals' folder, of which only a few samples are provided in the default application to not have to deal with any legal issues. The library will be extended in subsequent versions, but this application is also meant to participatory. Feel free to contribute to your child's experience by spending a few minutes searching the web for your favorite animal pictures and sounds to create your own extensions of the animal library.

Read the README.md file in the animals folder for more information.
