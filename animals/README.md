## Managing the 'animals' directory

This directory contains 1 folder per animal.
Each animal subfolder MUST contain at least 1 .MP3 file and 1 image (.PNG or .JPG). You may also have multiple images for the same animal, in which case a random one is selected each time the animal is used. For the moment you can only have 1 sound file per animal.
